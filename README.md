# PowerBI-Project 1 - Mountain Climbing Accidents Dataset
Project 1 - Mountain Climbing Accidents Dataset Analysis

# **Project Description**

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the 'Mountain Climbers Accident Dataset,' specifically targeting fatalities that occurred during attempts to summit the world's highest peaks, commonly referred to as the eight-thousanders. The primary objective was to extract valuable insights regarding the circumstances, patterns, and contributing factors associated with these tragic incidents.

## **About Dataset**

This dataset contains information on climbers who tragically lost their lives while attempting to summit the iconic eight thousanders. The eight thousanders are the 14 mountain peaks that reach or exceed an altitude of 8,000 meters above sea level.

## **Roadmap**

Data subset collected from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/mountain-climbing-accidents-dataset

1. Importing Dataset in PowerBi Dekstop.
2. Performing transformationa and cleaning (ETL) operations on the datset in power query editor.
3. Created data model by building relationship between Dimension and fact tables.
4. Using DAX to create necessary measure.
5. Created visualization using various charts.
6. Prepared PowerBi report.

## **Analysis Insights**
The dashboard shows:

1. Majority of fatalities occurred during the month of "May", which coincides with the peak season for climbing these mountains. This suggests that climbers tend to attempt summits during this period, leading to a higher incidence of accidents.
2. It was observed that the highest number of fatalities occurred among climbers from Nepal. This can be attributed to the fact that Nepal is home to most of the world's tallest peaks, indicating a higher number of Nepali climbers attempting to these summits.
3. Most common cause of death of the climbers was due to "Avalanches". This highlights the significant risk posed by avalanches in mountainous regions and shows the importance of avalanche safety measures for climbers.
4. Year 2013 recorded the highest number of deaths among climbers, with a total of 45 fatalities.
5. Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, accounted for the highest number of fatalities, with 30.58% of climbers losing their lives on this peak. The significant number of fatalities on Mount Everest can be attributed to its extreme height and popularity among climbers, resulting in a higher volume of summit attempts and consequently, a greater risk of accidents.
