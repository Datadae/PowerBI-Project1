# PowerBI-Project 1 - Mountain Climbing Accidents Dataset
Project 1 - Mountain Climbing Accidents Dataset Analysis

# **Project Description**

In this Project I analyze and gained insight on "Mountian climbers Accident dataset". Climbers who died while attempting to summit the world's eight thousanders.

## **About Dataset**

This dataset contains information on climbers who tragically lost their lives while attempting to summit the iconic eight thousanders. The eight thousanders are the 14 mountain peaks that reach or exceed an altitude of 8,000 meters above sea level.

## **Roadmap**

Data subset collected from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/mountain-climbing-accidents-dataset

-> Importing Dataset in PowerBi Dekstop
-> Performing transformationa and cleaning (ETL) operations on the datset in power query editor.
-> Created data model by building relationship between Dimension and fact tables
-> Using DAX to create necessary measure
-> Created visualization using various charts
-> Prepared PowerBi report

**#Analysis Insights**
The dashboard shows:

1. Most of the death took place in the month of "May". It's the peak season of summer and most climbers try the summit during this peroid.
2. Most common casuse of death was due to "Avalanche".
3. The most fatality were of the people who belonged to Nepal. Since, out of 14 peaks most of them are in nepal. It justify that more people from Nepal try reaching the summit.
4. 2013 recorded the most death in a year of the climbers. A sum of 45 deaths were recorded.
5. Mount Everest the tallest mountain has record of the most fatality, 30.58% climbers have lost their life on it.Being the tallest peak and more number of climbers trying to reach it sumit shows why more death are on this mountian range.
